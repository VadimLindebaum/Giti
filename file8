An algorithm is a set of defined steps designed to perform a specific objective. This can be a simple process, such as a recipe to bake a cake, or a complex series of operations used in machine learning to analyze large datasets and make predictions. In the context of machine learning, algorithms are vital as they facilitate the learning process for machines, helping them to identify patterns and make decisions based on data.
